CHANDLER: Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?<br>
</p><p>
EDDIE: Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Why?<br>
</p><p>
EDDIE: Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: I can't sleep now.<br>

EDDIE: You want me to sing?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment

</p><p>
<a name="line01"></a> EDDIE: Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line02"></a> EDDIE: No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night
you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see
me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice
enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: I didn't realize that.<br>
</p><p>
EDDIE: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>

EDDIE: No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Where did you hear it from before?<br>
</p><p>
EDDIE: Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know
what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.<br>

JOEY: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line04"></a> RACHEL: Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine
workin' huh?<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line05"></a> JOEY: Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th
avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: A mirror?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr.
Drake Remoray on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of
cache.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line06"></a> MONICA: Cache? Jaunty?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.<br>

</p><p>
PHOEBE: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Oh my God, it was incredible.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Didn't it like totally speak to you?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Rachel you have to read this book. It's called <i>Be Your Own Windkeeper</i>. It's
about how women need to become more empowered.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But
you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Men just take out wind?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Wow.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like <i>The Hobbit</i>.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've
ever had, except for Richard.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line07"></a> PHOEBE: Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: No.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: No, 'cause he's yummy.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Yes. But all the other ones.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of
inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Anybody want a croan.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line08"></a> PHOEBE: Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there,
it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'<br>

JOEY: So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?<br>
</p><p>
ESTELLE: Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: No, can we get back to me?<br>
</p><p>
ESTELLE: Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you
an audition for <i>Another World</i>.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Alright. Cab driver number two?<br>
</p><p>
ESTELLE: You're welcome.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a
cab?<br>
</p><p>
ESTELLE: Things change, roll with em.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do
this.<br>
</p><p>
ESTELLE: Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs.
Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.<br>

MONICA: Isn't it.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line09"></a> RACHEL: Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean
this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice
gift for you.<br>

</p><p>
MONICA: Hey.<br>
</p><p>

ROSS: No?<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line10"></a> RACHEL: No, why do we always have to do everything according to your
time table?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the
beginning.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.<br>

</p><p>
<a name="line13"></a> ROSS: I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees
and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's
pretty upset about it.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line14"></a> ROSS: What, what's that?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Open it, open in.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Oh my God.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Woah.<br>

ROSS: Toilet paper?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.<br>

JOEY: Ok.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.<br>
