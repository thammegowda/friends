at the bar, in their bathrobes, eating cereal]</b><br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his
hat?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a <b>cereal</b> for the
last 40 years.<br>
</p><p>
[Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.]<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Waaa-aaah.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: What?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah, so.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my
toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the
first thing you wash.<br>

CHANDLER: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA and PHOEBE: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Ahh.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Okey-doke.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: So where you gettin' it?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: What? What's on your shoulder?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair
cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: No, I think you should tell them.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them
anything.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and
Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: The Gellers' house. Monica, Ross, and Richard are arriving to Mr. Gellers
birthday party.]</b><br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Alright, shall we?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You
get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something
up.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
[opens door] We're here.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Oh hi kids. Hi darling.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Happy birthday dad.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Oh thank you.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Hi ma.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Happy birthday.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: The Gellers' kitchen. Monica, Mrs. Geller and one of Mrs. Geller's friends are
preparing the cake.]</b><br>
</p><p>
FRIEND: Well, you kids take the train in?<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.<br>
</p><p>
FRIEND: Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
[Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Are we still on that?<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.<br>
</p><p>
FRIEND: She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still
pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]</b><br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Can you believe this place?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: I know, this is a great apartment.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when
you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Huh?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the
kitchen.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning -
on TV. Stop talking. OK.<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross
observes.]</b><br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: C'mon, tell us.<br>
</p><p>
FRIEND: Yeah, is she really 20.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: I am not telling you guys anything.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Jack, would you let it go?<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche.
You... you got your own little speedster.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Guys. Seriously, it is <b>not</b> like that.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. .
.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.<br>

<b>[Scene: Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.]</b><br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Well I. . .<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more
open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.<br>
</p><p>
TATTOO ARTIST: Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with
me.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Here we go.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: [reluctantly] Uh-huh.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: You're not going?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Uh-huh.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: No. Well, yeah, maybe.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals
boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: What's 1922?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a
lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you
want to get this tattoo?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: No.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: OK, who is the boss of you?!!<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: You?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart
tattooed on your hip. <b>GO</b>!!<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]</b><br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: How ya doin'?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: I'm a twinkie.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Really? I'm a hero.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: My parents are dead.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Alright.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the
bathroom] Judy, <b>going to the bathroom</b>, good for you.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.<br>
</p><p>
[Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks
his head in.]<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I
have one.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from <i>Cocoon</i>.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told
Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Really.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: C'mon, it's my birthday.<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their
brunch.]</b><br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: What?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place
where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here
by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live
together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Well that's how I feel.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Well then maybe I will.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Fine with me.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the
spoons.<br>

MRS. GELLER: Almost time for cake.<br>

ROSS: Mon, Mon, are you OK?<br>

MONICA: You remember that video I found of mom and dad?<br>

ROSS: Yeah.<br>

MONICA: Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.<br>

[Mrs. Geller and Ross both enter]<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Uhh, not that I know of.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: That - that's an idea.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Oh?<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Oh?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Ohh.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of
them aren't. Is that crystal?<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: A real doctor?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's
sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Well that's wonderful. . . I<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Mom, it's OK.<br>

RICHARD: It is Judy.<br>

MRS. GELLER: Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!<br>

MR. GELLER: [enters with his bat] Found it.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]<br>

MRS. GELLER: It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.<br>

MONICA: Dad, I'm the twinkie.<br>
</p><p>
MR. GELLER: You're the twinkie?<br>

RICHARD: She's not a twinkie.<br>

MONICA: Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .<br>
</p><p>
MRS. GELLER: Oh please, a relationship.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.<br>
</p><p>
RICHARD: Really?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Yes.<br>

MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've
never seen Richard happier.<br>

JOEY: Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores]<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yes! And the table is mine.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]<br>
</p><p>
<b>[Scene: Chandler's apartment. The whole gang is helping Joey pack.]</b><br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler
gives him a look] except when we are here.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my
bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling
water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get
theirs accross the street.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: [quietly] Yeah, I remember.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.<br>
</p><p>
[Everyone except Joey and Chandler leave.]<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Thanks.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: So, I guess this is it.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.<br>
</p><p>
[Joey walks to the door. He stops, turns around.]</p>

<p align="center"><br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>
[Joey walks out and after a few seconds comes back in and gives Chandler a big hug. He
then leaves for good and Chandler is left alone in his apartment.]<br>
