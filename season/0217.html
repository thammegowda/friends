but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but,
when I moved out, I hurt him bad.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: I promise you, he would definitely want you back.<br>
</p><p>

was like when we first started living together.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new
place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.<br>
