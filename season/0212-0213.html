his desk. The guy looks dejected.]<br>
</p><p>
COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...<br>
</p><p>
[A monkey jumps on the desk and hands the guy a beer. He opens the beer and is suddenly on
the beach, in a hammock, with beautiful women all around.]<br>
</p><p>
COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: ...With MonkeyShine Beer. [MonkeyShine theme] MonkeyShine Beer,
'cause it's a jungle out there.]</i><br>
</p><p>
[Camera pans back from the TV to show the gang watching.]<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: That commercial always makes me so sad.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything
seems to work out OK.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the
little pouty chin.<br>
MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a
Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd
be little monkey raisins in it.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. .
. all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.<br>

ALL: Alright!<br>

MONICA: [reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have
you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please
find 14 of my eyelashes.'<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: This wasn't addressed to <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, this is, this came to your
apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.<br>

PHOEBE: Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then
drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh,
you know, isn't capable of that emotion.<br>

[Rob (Chris Isaac) enters]<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's
really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.<br>

ROB: I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Oh, wow.<br>
</p><p>
ROB: Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was
just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?<br>

PHOEBE: Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs
that I will write for them.<br>

ERICA: It's Erica.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Ah, the stalker.<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: Never mind, it's open.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: [Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We
might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Let's get out of here.<br>
</p><p>
[They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door]<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: The one time they're not home.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me
'cause we've never met.<br>
CHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: She's comin'.<br>

CHANDLER: Wait, wait, wait. [Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding]<br>

<b>[Scene: San Diego Zoo. Ross is at the Monkey cages.]</b><br>
</p><p>
LIPSON: Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan,
answers to the name Marcel.<br>
</p><p>
LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?<br>
</p><p>
LIPSON: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then
he died.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: I can't believe this.<br>
</p><p>
LIPSON: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.'
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.<br>
</p><p>
LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Zoo dollars?<br>
</p><p>
LIPSON: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.<br>

</p><p>
PHOEBE: I know.<br>

MONICA: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well, you remember Cathy Bates in <i>Misery</i>?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL AND MONICA: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: And she's not crazy?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr.
Drake Remore.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Oh my God.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the
magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not
deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one
who wants to boff the maniac.<br>
</p><p>
ROB: You OK?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture
them all in their underwear.<br>
</p><p>
ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just,
grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This
is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: I was thinkin' about it.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe<br>
</p><p>
ALL: Hi Phoebe.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing]<br>
<i>Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes,<br>
she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike.<br>
But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner,<br>

ERICA: Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah it is. . . what?<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching
someone's spinal cord.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for 2 minites.<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: Who's they?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: No one.<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these
beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to
be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at
that.<br>
</p><p>
[Some guy at another table starts choking]<br>
</p><p>
WAITER: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.<br>
</p><p>

JANITOR: It's about your monkey. It's alive.<br>

<b>[Scene: Restraunt. Joey and Erica are still there.]</b><br>

ERICA: I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal
chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: But that's what...<br>
</p><p>
ERICA: I should just be happy to be near you.<br>

truth.You were incredible.<br>

PHOEBE: But.<br>
</p><p>
ROB: How did you know there was a but?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I sense these things. It was either but or butter.<br>
</p><p>
ROB: The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play
more songs about like, barnyard animals.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I can do that.<br>

ROB: Really?<br>

JANITOR: The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.<br>
</p><p>
JANITOR: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's
all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?<br>

ROSS: That guy Lipson?<br>
</p><p>
JANITOR: Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?<br>

SUSIE: Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw
my underpants.<br>

RACHEL: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the
