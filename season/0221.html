<p align="left">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is there. Monica is
watching stock prices on a business channel.]</b><br>
</p><p>
<a name="line01"></a> JOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my
initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it
comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Ok honey, you really need a job.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Really.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line02"></a> PHOEBE: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right
there.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line03"></a> PHOEBE: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I
keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I
passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.<br>
</p><p>
EVERYONE: Ahh.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And
there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: His indian name?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean
coincidences? I don't think so.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Freakish.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Wow.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Freaky.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Weird, weird.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line04"></a> RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Why?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.<br>

ROSS: Oh, sorry we didn't know.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: [walks back from the counter] Hey, we were sitting there.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line07"></a> LITTLE BULLY: Is that supposed to be funny?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: No actually, I was just going for colorful.<br>

BIG BULLY: What's with this guy?<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: What's with you?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.<br>

<a name="line08"></a> [as they're walking off, little bully grabs Chandlers hat from
behind and puts it on himself]<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: What just happened?<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took
your hat.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: That, that is funny. Can I have it back?<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: No.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: No?<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: No.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come
on guy just, just give him back the hat.<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Why should we?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: <a name="line09"></a>Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See
he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself
up, ya know. Now Chandler...<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually
stealing my hat?<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: You got a problem with that?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.<br>

</p><p>
RACHEL: Hey, how'd the interview go?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on
the counter. <a name="line10"></a>I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how
could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: So don't do it.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.<br>

</p><p>
MONICA: [seeing TV] Hey, I went up.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: What?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had
invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya
know what, I'm gonna do it.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Do what?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Put all my money in me.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock
market.<br>

</p><p>
CHANDLER: Hey.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: What?<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line18"></a> CHANDLER: Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to
wear those really cool jackets?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Do you say this stuff to girls?<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: And look where they're sitting.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line19"></a> BIG BULLY: This couch belongs to us.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call
the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line43"></a> ROSS: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther,
these guys are trying to take our seat.<br>

GUNTHER: Fellas, these guys were here first.<br>

LITTLE BULLY: Sorry.<br>

GUNTHER: There you go.<br>

ROSS: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.<br>

ROSS: Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's
tie]<br>

ROSS: I know.<br>

ROSS: Yeah.<br>

back]<br>

you guys.<br>

LITTLE BULLY: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your
faces in this coffee house ever again.<br>

</p><p>
PHOEBE: Yeah, I don't know.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: What's the matter?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at
the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for
my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite
what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.
I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?<br>

time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Time is money my friend?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down
there and kick your wall street butt.'<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line25"></a> MONICA: Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: How did you make $17.<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Well, my financially challenged friends, <a name="line44"></a> I split my money
and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: How come those?<br>
</p><p>
MONICA: Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think
it sounds zexy.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: What happened to uh, MEG.?<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line26"></a> MONICA: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is
get out before they go down.<br>

PHOEBE: [enters] Hey.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?<br>

PHOEBE: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the
little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Good.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Oh, thank God.<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line27"></a> PHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he
said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.<br>
</p><p>
RACHEL: Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is
ok?<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. <a name="line45"></a> What am I
gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your
dog.'<br>
</p><p>
JOEY: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.<br>

dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within,
within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]<br>

FRANK: Except stilts.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: Stilts?<br>
</p><p>
FRANK: Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my
mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past
the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always
happiest when he was on his stilts.<br>

Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'<br>

FRANK: I gotta friend named Mark.<br>
</p><p>
PHOEBE: That'll work too.<br>

or somethin'.<br>

his head on the rain gutter.<br>

<b>[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Ross are sitting on the couch nervously.]</b><br>
</p><p>
<a name="line37"></a> ROSS: Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How
long does a cup of coffee take?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.<br>
</p><p>
[They rush to put the cream and sugar in their cups and gulp down a few drinks]<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Ah, there we go.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: I think we proved our point.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: You burn your mouth?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Cannot feel my tounge.<br>
</p><p>
[They leave. As they're walking out, the bullies are walking in.]<br>
</p><p>
<a name="line38"></a> CHANDLER: Bullies, big bullies.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Yes, and that's why we're here.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Let's do this alright.<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Alright, let's do this.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Alright.<br>
</p><p>
[they all put up their fists and prepare to fight]<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Whad'ya mean?<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage
with it.<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: No, you can't use your watch.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Ok. [reaches in his pocket]<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Or your keys.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Ok.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over
there. Alright. [they all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box]
Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.<br>
</p><p>
[they all jump in the street and prepare to fight]<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Before I forget, are we hitting faces?<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?<br>
</p><p>
ROSS: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you
know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Ok, nothing from the neck up. [everyone gets ready for the fight] Or the waist
down. Dana's ovulating.<br>
</p><p>
LITTLE BULLY: Oh really, you guys tryin' again?<br>
</p><p>
BIG BULLY: Yeah.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the

</p><p>

</p><p>
<a name="line40"></a> ROSS: God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You

</p><p>
ROSS: Yeah he was wasn't he.<br>
</p><p>
CHANDLER: Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.<br>
</p><p>

girls jump-rope.<br>
</p><p>

the rest of the staff have to get on the counter and start singing along and dancing.
After a couple of couruses, Chandler pulls out a handful of coins and drops them on the
table.]<br>
